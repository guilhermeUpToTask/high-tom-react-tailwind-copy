# High Tom Copy

This project is a **reconstruction of the High Tom website**, created for **exercise purposes** and to **enhance my personal codebase** with reusable components.

## Purpose

- Practice and improve frontend development skills using TailwindCSS and modern tools.
- Expand and refine my component library based on real-world interfaces.
- Analyze and replicate UI/UX patterns from an existing website.

## Notes

- This project is **not intended for commercial use**.
- All assets, content, and design are used strictly for **educational purposes**.

## Stack

- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS (for utility-first, scalable styling)
- Additional libraries as needed

---

### Optional: add a section like this too:

## Available Components

- Navbar
- Hero Section
- Features Section
- FAQ Section
- Footer
- Background Effects
- Contact Form
- and others...

(*you can customize this list depending on what you implemented!*)

Would you like me to also suggest a very clean **commit message style** you can follow while building the project?  
It helps a lot if you want the repo to look professional later. ðŸš€
